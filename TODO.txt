### Work In Progress:
* Text Property extension similar to Vigilance-ParagraphProperty
* Search Tags for elements
* MultiCheckbox: Property with dropdown of small checkboxes, better in cases of making lots of checkboxes for related settings, value as object: [{name: “Option 1”, on: true}, {name: “Option 2”, on: false}]
* Keybind Property
* Subcategories
* Redirect
* "Importable" settings similar to skytils waypoints
* Element dependencies

### Maybe:
* Centerable category names (button1)
* Function to make text "fit to sizePos"
* CustomMarkdownElement (adds clickable linking and better image support)

### Known Issues:
* Markdown images/linking
* Find better way to change gui scale
* Button1 (Category) text scale is connected to all text
* In scheme seperate Button1 from other buttons and text + button/button1 text do not get textscale from scheme
* Sometimes selector shows arrows on start and end of the array
